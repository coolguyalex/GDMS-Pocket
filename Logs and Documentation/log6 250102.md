# GDMS Pocket – Development Log

**Date:** 2026-01-02  
**Hardware Platform:** Adafruit Feather RP2040 Adalogger  
**Goal:** Validate display options and bring up core I/O (buttons, LED, buzzer) in preparation for GDMS Pocket firmware development.

## 1. E‑Paper (eInk) Display Exploration

### Hardware Tested
- Adafruit 2.13" Tri‑Color eInk FeatherWing (SSD1680)
- Integrated directly onto the Feather RP2040 via Feather headers

### Goals
- Evaluate e‑paper as a low‑power, high‑legibility display option
- Assess refresh behavior and suitability for menu‑driven interaction

### Findings
- The e‑paper FeatherWing integrates cleanly at the hardware level.
- Full refresh behavior is inherent to the technology:
  - Refreshes are slow compared to OLED
  - Visible flashing during refresh is unavoidable
- Partial refresh support is limited and highly controller‑specific.
- The display is best suited for:
  - Static information
  - Infrequently changing screens
  - “Page‑based” interaction rather than cursor‑based UI

### Conclusion
While visually appealing and power‑efficient, e‑paper was deemed **not ideal for early GDMS Pocket prototyping**, where:
- Rapid iteration
- Frequent screen updates
- Cursor‑based menus

are required. The e‑paper display remains a **strong candidate for future variants** or alternative builds focused on ultra‑low power or static reference use.

## 2. OLED Bring‑Up and System Integration

### Display
- 0.96" SSD1306 I²C OLED (128×64, monochrome)

### Wiring Validation
- I²C (SDA/SCL) connected to Feather defaults
- OLED powered from 3V rail
- Successful I²C device scan confirmed communication

### CircuitPython Setup
- Required libraries:
  - `adafruit_ssd1306`
  - `adafruit_framebuf`
- Resolved missing `font5x8.bin` error by:
  - Adding font file to CIRCUITPY root
  - Verifying text rendering functionality

### Graphics Capabilities Confirmed
- Full framebuffer access (1‑bit, 128×64)
- Successful use of:
  - Text rendering
  - Filled rectangles
  - Simple animation
- Determined that CircuitPython + SSD1306 is sufficient for:
  - Menus
  - Icons
  - Cursors
  - Simple UI animation

### Button Bring‑Up
- Four momentary buttons wired using internal pull‑ups:
  - Active‑low (button to GND)
- Final functional mapping (after discovery of swapped wiring):
  - Physical UP / DOWN / A / B correctly detected
- Verified via serial console event logging

### LED Test
- External green LED on pin D11
- Confirmed:
  - Proper current limiting resistor
  - GPIO control
  - Stable blinking behavior

### Buzzer Test
- Passive buzzer wired:
  - + to D12
  - − to GND
- PWM audio output tested successfully
- Confirmed tone generation and duty‑cycle control

### System Status
At the end of this session, the following components are fully operational under CircuitPython:

- OLED display (graphics + text)
- Four buttons (reliable input)
- Status LED
- Passive buzzer

This establishes a **solid hardware and firmware foundation** for moving on to:
- UI layout work
- Menu navigation logic
- Applet/page architecture
- GDMS Pocket core features

**Next Steps (Deferred):**
- Unified input + display UI loop
- Menu/cursor rendering
- Dice and table navigation logic
- Storage integration strategy
