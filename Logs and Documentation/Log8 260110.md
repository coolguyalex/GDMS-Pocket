# GDMS Pocket – Dev Log  
## SH1107 1.5" OLED Bring-Up, Pin Mapping, and Hardware Validation

### Date
January 2026

---

## Goal of This Session
Bring up a newly received **1.5" SH1107 OLED (SPI)** on a **Feather RP2040 Adalogger**, resolve display alignment issues, finalize a clean pin map for all peripherals (OLED, buttons, LED, buzzer), and validate everything with a single hardware test sketch.

---

## Hardware Used
- Adafruit Feather RP2040 Adalogger
- 1.5" OLED, controller marked **SH1107**, SPI interface (AliExpress module)
- 4 momentary buttons (active-low)
- Passive buzzer (3-pin module)
- Single indicator LED + resistor

## OLED Bring-Up and Debugging

### Initial Issues
- Screen powered but showed:
  - shifted / wrapped content
  - apparent ~32px horizontal offset
- U8g2 rotation flags and page buffer settings did **not** resolve the issue.

### Root Cause Identified
The issue was traced to the **U8g2 SH1107 128×128 driver** (`u8x8_d_sh1107.c`).

In the `u8x8_sh1107_128x128_display_info` struct, the library defines:

```c
default_x_offset = 96
flipmode_x_offset = 96
