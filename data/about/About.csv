"Goblinoid Dungeon Mastering System was created to help creatives of all sorts find inspiration in their storytelling endeavors. GDMS is  nspired by OSR-style minimalism and aims to give that little bit of inspiration the human brain needs to start whirring. GDMS was created in 2020 and ported to pocket version by Alexander Sousa in Providence Rhode Island in 2026. Special thanks to Kristina Michael Scout Jake Vieira and the Durfee High School Tabletop Club. Never stop creating."
