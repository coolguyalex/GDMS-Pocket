### Text desciption:

I have the screen, and the SD card reader mentioned in uploaded the readme as well as an elegoo nano MCU. I also have a three buttons. lets make a little proof on concept system. It will have two pages displayed on the SSD1316 one will be for NPC names and the other will be a dice roller. 

The pages will be simple. 

The names page will simple say "NAMES" and if the user hits the middle button it will randomly pull up a name from the csv list. 

The dice roller page will say "DICE". If the user hits the center button it will enter a submenu which will had d4,d6,d8,d10.d12.d20,d100 listed. The use can hit the right button to cycle through the options or hit the left button to go back to the "DICE" screen. If the user hits the center button it will roll the dice indicated and provide a number. if the user hits the center button again it will roll again. if the user hits the left (back) button they will be returned to the dice selection screen. 

The three buttons will be arranged in a line lets call them A, B, and C from left to right. Button A will be the back button and be used for leaving, Button B will be the commit button and be used for selection and button c will be for advancing selection: either to the next page or the next item in a list.
